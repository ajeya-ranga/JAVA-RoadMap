# <u>Ultimate Git & GitHub Interview Prep Guide</u>

--------------------------------------------

## The Introduction (The "What" and "Why")

--------------------------------------------------

### 1. What is Git?

Git is a **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**.

* **The Analogy:** Think of it as a "Time Machine" for your code. It takes snapshots (commits) of your project at specific points in time.
* **Key Feature:** It is "Distributed," meaning every developer has a full copy of the project history on their local machine. You don't need an internet connection to work or look at the history.
  
  

### 2. What is GitHub?

GitHub is a **Cloud Hosting Service** for Git repositories.

* **The Analogy:** If Git is the "camera" that takes photos (snapshots), GitHub is "Instagram" or "Google Photos" where you upload them to share with others.
* **Key Feature:** It adds a collaboration layer on top of Git, providing tools for Code Reviews (Pull Requests), Project Management (Jira-like boards), and CI/CD actions.
  
  

### 3. Why is it the Industry Standard?

We use Git and GitHub to solve five specific problems:

- **Collaboration:** Multiple developers (like you and your team) can work on the *same* file at the *same* time without overwriting each other's work.
- **Safety (Undo Button):** If a new feature breaks the application, we can instantly revert to a previous working state.
- **Feature Isolation:** We can work on new features in separate "Branches" so the production code remains stable.
- **Code Quality:** via **Pull Requests**, where peers review code before it merges into the main project.
- **Backup:** If your laptop breaks, the code is safe in the remote repository.
  
  
  
  

## Part 1: Beginner Level (The Fundamentals)

--------------------------------------------

**1. What is the main difference between Git and GitHub?**

* **Git:** A version control **software** installed locally on your computer to track code changes. It works offline.
* **GitHub:** A cloud-based **hosting service** for Git repositories. It enables collaboration, pull requests, and backups. It requires the internet.
  
  

**2. What are the "Three States" (or Areas) in Git?**

1. **Working Directory:** Your current folder with active edits (Unsaved changes).
2. **Staging Area (Index):** A "holding area" where you prepare files for the next commit.
3. **Repository (Local Repo):** The `.git` folder where Git permanently stores the history (commits).
   
   

**3. What is the difference between `git add` and `git commit`?**

* **`git add`:** Moves changes from the Working Directory to the Staging Area.
* **`git commit`:** Moves changes from the Staging Area to the Local Repository, saving a snapshot of the project.
  
  

**4. What is `git init`?**

* It turns the current folder into a Git repository by creating a hidden `.git` subfolder that tracks all changes.
  
  

**5. What is the purpose of `.gitignore`?**

* A text file listing patterns of files that Git should **intentionally ignore** (e.g., `.class` files, `target/` folders, or API keys). This keeps the repository clean.
  
  

**6. What is a "Branch"?**

* An independent line of development that allows you to work on features or fixes in isolation without affecting the main codebase.
  
  

**7. What is `git status` used for?**

* It displays the state of your working directory. It shows:
  * Files modified but not staged.
  * Files staged and ready to commit.
  * New "untracked" files.
    
    

**8. What does `git clone` do?**

* It downloads a full copy of an existing remote repository (like from GitHub) to your local machine, including the entire history of changes.
  
  

**9. What is a "Merge Conflict"?**

* It occurs when Git cannot automatically join two branches because the **same line** in the **same file** was modified differently in both branches. Manual intervention is required.
  
  

**10. How do you check the history of your project?**

* Use `git log`. It lists commits in reverse chronological order, showing the Commit ID (Hash), Author, and Message.
  
  

## Part 2: Intermediate & Advanced

---------------------------------------------------------------

**11. What is the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`?**

* **`git fetch`:** Downloads new data from the remote repository but **does not** integrate it into your files. It is safe to run anytime.
* **`git pull`:** Downloads changes **and** immediately merges them into your current branch.
* *Formula:* `git pull` = `git fetch` + `git merge`.
  
  

**12. Explain `git merge` vs. `git rebase`.**

* **Merge:** Creates a new "merge commit" to tie branches together. Preserves exact history (truthful history).
* **Rebase:** Moves your feature branch to the tip of the main branch, rewriting history to make it linear (straight). It keeps logs cleaner but modifies history.
  
  

**13. What is the Gitflow workflow?**

* A strict branching model for releases using specific branches:
  * **Main:** Production-ready code.
  * **Develop:** Integration branch for next release.
  * **Feature:** For new work.
  * **Release:** For release prep.
  * **Hotfix:** For urgent production bugs.
    
    

**14. What is `git cherry-pick`?**

* A command to pick a specific commit from one branch and apply it to another.
* *Use Case:* Applying a specific bug fix from `dev` to `prod` without merging unfinished features.
  
  

**15. Difference between `git reset --soft`, `--mixed`, and `--hard`?**

* **`--soft`:** Undoes commit, keeps changes in **Staging**.
* **`--mixed`:** Undoes commit, keeps changes in **Working Dir** (unstaged).
* **`--hard`:** Undoes commit and **deletes** all changes.
  
  

**16. How do you resolve a Merge Conflict?**

1. **Identify** the conflicted file.
2. **Open** it in an editor.
3. **Edit** the code to choose the correct version (remove `<<<<`, `====`, `>>>>` markers).
4. **Add** the file (`git add`).
5. **Commit** the resolution.
   
   

**17. What is `git stash`?**

* Temporarily shelves (saves) uncommitted changes so you can switch branches to work on something else. You can restore them later using `git stash pop`.
  
  

**18. What is the difference between "Fork" and "Clone"?**

* **Clone:** Makes a local copy on your machine.
* **Fork:** Makes a server-side copy on your GitHub account. Used for contributing to open-source projects where you don't have write access to the original repo.
  
  

**19. What is Interactive Rebase (`git rebase -i`)?**

* A tool to edit commits while rebasing. It allows you to **Squash** (combine) commits, **Reword** messages, or **Drop** commits to clean up history before merging.
  
  

**20. What is a "Detached HEAD" state?**

* It happens when you checkout a specific **Commit ID** instead of a branch. Any new commits made here will be lost when you switch away unless you create a new branch to save them.
