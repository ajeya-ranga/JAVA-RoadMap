# <u>Programming Fundamentals.</u>

#### The Nature of Programming Languages

At its core, a computer hardware system operates solely on machine code, which consists of binary sequences (zeros and ones). Because writing binary is inefficient and error-prone for humans, we use programming languages as an abstraction layer. A programming language functions as a formal interface that translates human-readable logic into machine-executable instructions.

These languages exist on a spectrum of abstraction. 

<u>**Low-level languages**</u>, such as Assembly, provide little abstraction from the hardware, requiring the programmer to manage CPU registers and memory addresses manually. In contrast, <u>**High-level languages**</u> (like Java, Python, or C++) abstract away these hardware details, allowing the developer to focus on business logic using syntax that resembles natural English. The gap between the high-level code we write and the low-level code the machine executes is bridged by translators, specifically compilers and interpreters.

#### Programming Paradigms: Procedural, OOP, and Functional

A programming paradigm is a fundamental style or approach to organizing code and solving problems. It dictates how the developer structures the logic and manages the state of the application.

**<u>Procedural Programming</u>** is the traditional approach, often described as an imperative "recipe." Ideally suited for linear tasks, it structures the program as a sequence of instructions or procedures (functions) that manipulate shared, global data. The primary focus is on the process—step A, followed by step B. The limitation of this paradigm is that data and the functions that operate on it are separated, which can lead to "spaghetti code" in large systems where it becomes difficult to track which function is modifying which variable.

**<u>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</u>** arose to solve the scalability issues of procedural programming. Instead of separating data and logic, OOP bundles them together into units called "Objects." An object is a model of a real-world entity that contains its own data (attributes) and the specific code to manipulate that data (methods). This concept, known as Encapsulation, ensures that the state of an object is protected from outside interference. OOP focuses on who acts on the data rather than just the sequence of actions, making it the dominant paradigm for large-scale enterprise systems like those built in Java.

**<u>Functional Programming (FP)</u>** approaches software construction from a mathematical perspective. Unlike Procedural or OOP, which rely on changing the state of variables (mutability), Functional Programming emphasizes "immutability." In this paradigm, data is never modified; instead, functions accept input and produce entirely new output without side effects. It treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions rather than the execution of commands. This approach reduces bugs related to state changes and makes the code highly suitable for parallel processing, which is why modern Java has adopted functional features like Streams and Lambdas.

#### Type Systems: Static vs. Dynamic Typing

The distinction between static and dynamic languages lies fundamentally in when the system checks data types (such as ensuring an integer is not treated as a string).

<u>**Statically Typed Languages**</u> (like Java, C++, and Swift) enforce type safety at compile-time. This means the programmer must explicitly declare the data type of a variable, or the compiler must be able to infer it definitively before the code is ever run. If there is a type mismatch—for example, trying to assign text to a numeric variable—the compiler will reject the code and prevent the program from building. This theoretical constraint offers two major advantages: it catches errors early in the development cycle, and it allows the compiler to optimize the code for faster execution.

**<u>Dynamically Typed Languages </u>**(like Python, JavaScript, and Ruby) perform type checking at runtime. Variables are not bound to a specific data type; instead, the value inside the variable determines the type at the moment of execution. A variable can hold a number in one line and a string in the next. While this offers immense flexibility and allows for faster prototyping (less code to write), it introduces the risk of runtime errors, where a program might crash while in use because of an unexpected data type mismatch that wasn't caught during development.

#### Execution Models: Compilation vs. Interpretation

To bridge the gap between source code and hardware, languages typically use one of two conversion methods.

**<u>Compilation</u>** is the process where the entire source code is translated into machine code (binary) at once by a compiler before the program runs. This creates a standalone executable file. The theoretical benefit is performance, as the translation work is already done. However, the resulting binary is platform-dependent; a program compiled for Windows will not run on Linux.

<u>**Interpretation**</u> is the process where a program called an interpreter translates the source code line-by-line while the program is running. This allows for great flexibility and platform independence (the code can run anywhere the interpreter is installed), but generally results in slower performance because the computer is translating and executing simultaneously.

Java's Hybrid Approach: Java is unique because it combines both theories. When you write Java code, it is first compiled into an intermediate language called Bytecode (.class files). This Bytecode is not machine code for any specific computer. When you run the program, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) takes this Bytecode and interprets (or JIT compiles) it into the specific machine code for the device it is running on. This two-step process is the theoretical basis for Java's famous "Write Once, Run Anywhere" capability.
